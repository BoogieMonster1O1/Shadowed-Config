# Shadowed Config
Provides useful serialization, registry and configuration utilities.

## Setup
Since the bintray repository got shut down, shadowed config is not published to a maven repository anymore.
This will be fixed in the future.

## Contributing
- Use java only for mixins
- Use scala for everything else
- Use java classes (java.lang.List, java.lang.Iterable) instead of scala classes (scala.List, scala.Iterable)
- For scala files, use **Tabs**, not two spaces
- LF or bad
